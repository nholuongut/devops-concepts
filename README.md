Test-driven Development(TDD): A.K.A Test First Development, form of programming in which coding, testing (unit testing), and design (refractoring) are closely linked. Test cases are created for each function to see if the test fails if so then new code is written in order to pass the test; this ensures the code is simple and bug-free.

1. Add a test.
2. Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
3. Write some code.
4. Run tests and Refactor code.
5. Repeat.

TDD ensures that your system actually meets requirements defined for it. It helps to build your confidence about your system.
In TDD more focus is on production code that verifies whether testing will work properly. In traditional testing, more focus is on test case design.
